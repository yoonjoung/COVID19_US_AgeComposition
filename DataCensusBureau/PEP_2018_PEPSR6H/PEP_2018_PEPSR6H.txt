Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States, States, and Counties: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018

Notes:
The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions.
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be of any race.
Responses of "Some Other Race" from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences
between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in
this table versus those in the original 2010 Census data. For more information, see 
https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/modified-race-summary-file-method/mrsf2010.pdf. For population
estimates methodology statements, see

The 6,222 people in Bedford city, Virginia, which was an independent city as of the 2010 Census, are not included in the April 1, 2010 Census enumerated population presented in the county estimates. In July 2013, the legal status of Bedford changed from a city to a town and it became dependent within (or part of) Bedford County, Virginia. This population of Bedford town is now included in the April 1, 2010 estimates base and all July 1 estimates for Bedford County. Because it is no longer an independent city, Bedford town is not listed in this table. As a result, the sum of the April 1, 2010 census values for Virginia counties and independent cities does not equal the 2010 Census count for Virginia, and the sum of April 1, 2010 census values for all counties and independent cities in the United States does not equal the 2010 Census count for the United States. Substantial geographic changes to counties can be found on the Census Bureau website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html.
